# TICTACTOE
A tic tac toe game written in Python that is playable in the terminal.


this game is two player, let's player one choose 'X' or 'O' and assigns player two the leftover.
replay option is available upon game won or game tie

the only issue i have is instead of saying 'please choose an empty space' it will just constantly ask for a valid move.
